        <h2>Product Design &commat; Hy-Vee</h2>
        
        <p><i>Due to confidentiality requirements, I'm unable to share most of my design work from Hy-Vee. If you'd like to discuss my experience further, please <a href="contact.html" title="link to contact page">contact me</a>.</i></p>

        <p>Hy-Vee is a large grocery, pharmacy and food service retailer in the Midwest. The company is undergoing a radical digital transformation to stay ahead of the changing retail and grocery landscape. As part of the UI/UX team at Hy-Vee, I design and deliver digital solutions that make our customers' lives easier, healthier and happier.</p>
        <p>
        I'm currently working with the mobile team to design and build a new customer-facing app. As the sole designer for the product, I'm responsible for UX research, customer flows, wireframes, UI/visual design and user testing. I'm also working with my engineering teammates to implement a design system and reusable/scalable React Native components for the platform.</p>

        <p>I previously designed and tested Hy-Vee's food ordering kiosk as part of two-designer team. We synthesized business and customer requirements, produced user flows and wireframes and delivered hi-fidelity visual designs on a very tight timeline. I conducted in-person user testing with customers and helped the mobile team quickly iterate on and deploy UI improvements within one week. The kiosks currently serve customers in stores across the midwest.
