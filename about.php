          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I've been interested in design and interactive technologies for a long time â€“ I even built sites on Geocities and Tripod way back in the day. More recently, I've developed a strong interest in designing and building PRODUCTS: web apps, interfaces, games, etc. I'm looking to join a digital agency or dev team to contribute my skills and continue to grow while helping people solve their creative and business problems.</p>

          <p>I have a BA in Spanish from University of Northern Iowa and an MA in Linguistics from Ohio State. I'm currently working on a post-bacc certificate in Interactive Design and Marketing from <a href="http://mcad.edu/academic-programs/interactive-design-and-marketing-certificate" target="_blank">MCAD</a>.</p>
